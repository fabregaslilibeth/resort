      longDescription: "Home to most of the marine life you find around Puerto Galera, Sabang Wrecks is perhaps the most famous dive site in Puerto Galera. At first glance, the three wrecks don’t look too impressive. One small steel yacht, and two wooden boats in different stages of decay. Look closer. A school of batfish, lots of smaller damsels, butterfly fish and surgeonfish wil swim by. Numerous very well camouflaged scorpion fish and stonefish live on the wrecks. Bring a torch and look underneath, and you’ll find giant moray eels, lionfish, crabs and shrimps as well as schools of cat fish and squirrel fish hiding during the day. Stargazers, snake eels, flounders, frogfish and pipefish are common here. With a great guide, you might also find robust ghost pipefish and ornate ghost pipefish, moth fish, flying gurnards and leaf fish trying to blend into the sand. It is also a great night dive, bringing out cuttle fish of all varieties, squids, pleurobranchs, flatworms and moray eels out hunting in the open."

Between the coral heads, giant plate corals, staghorn corals and barrel sponges, you will find soft corals abundant with reef fish such as antheas, parrotfish, large schools of sergeant majors, damsel fish butterflyfish and angel fish. Look closer in the sand or under the outcroppings, and you will find gobies, lizard fish, shrimps, scorpionfish, juvenile lionfish and the occasional grouper.

Look around in the sand and you’ll find lots of small holes, most of them inhabited by the shy jaw fish. See anything green running swiftly over the sand from one coral to the next? It’s probably a mantis shrimp, they are very common here. Plenty of small reef fish, crinoids and nudibranchs."

Whilst you swim through the hole, beware of lionfish and scorpionfish, as well as the feather like hydroids growing on the walls – they sting! Good buoyancy is a must. The top of the wall is covered in colorful soft coral attracting many colorful fish. Octopus, frogfish, turtles, sea snakes, anything can appear here. On the other side, lies another wall, covered in soft coral, sponges, green tree coral and fans, it is the hiding place for many morays and puffers and it drops off into a flat lunar like landscape with whole gardens of whip corals, vibrating in the current. This can be a very easy dive, even novices – with good buoyancy control – can dive it."

Also look around for moray eels: white eyed, clouded, many of f them stay in this area. See a black crinoid looking bulkier than normal? It’s probably a frogfish. During the colder months, a big barracuda has often been seen resting close to the wall, Continue deeper from the wall and you will encounter the wreck of an old sailing catamaran. Inside the two hulls hide ringed pipefish, lionfish, puffer fish and juveniles of all sorts. On your way shallower, you will find that big carpet anemones are common here, many of them inhabited not only by anemone fish but also by porcelain crabs."

Drop in close to Hole In The Wall and let the current take you deeper along the slope, where currents and mother nature formed three spectacular canyons in the reef, with sheltering walls and sandy bottoms, where you can kneel down and rest – and watch the big fish fighting in the current above your head. On all sides of the Canyons, the slope quickly drops down to 40 meters plus, so the only way once you get to the Canyons is… up! Schooling drums, trevallies, batfish, sweetlips and the big sea fans. Inside the canyons you’ll find octopus, scorpionfish, sea snakes and other reef fish. At the end of the third and deepest canyon (30 m), there is an old Spanish anchor embedded in the rock. We sometimes spot bigger animals here: Manta rays, thresher sharks and hammerhead sharks have all been seen here. Best done in nitrox, this dive is different depending on the tides, and ends with a blue water ascent and a safety stop in blue water.",
