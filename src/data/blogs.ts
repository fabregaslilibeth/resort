            <h2>Meet Jamie Morton: The Fastest Man on Two Fins and One Propeller</h2>
            
            <p>A dive centre is only as good as its people and here at Lalaguna Villas we are fortunate to work with some of the very best in the business.</p>
            
            <p>Today the LLV blog sat down with our man from the Solomon Islands, IDC Staff Instructor Jamie Morton, 52. We talked about thresher sharks, exploding coconuts, and his beloved DPV safaris.</p>
            
            <h3>From Solomon Islands to Puerto Galera</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Hi Jamie! So tell us… where are you from and how did you get into diving?</strong></p>
            
            <p>I was brought up in the water really, in and on the water. We moved to the Solomon Islands when I was seven and I learned to swim there, so I was swimming and snorkelling and freediving in the ocean on a daily basis – out on a custom-built canoe.</p>
            
            <p>My parents introduced me to diving there when I was very young, strapped a monkey-rigged tank onto me and took me diving.</p>
            
            <h3>Childhood Adventures in Guadalcanal</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What are your memories of those childhood dives? Did you see anything shocking?</strong></p>
            
            <p>The reef system is amazing on Guadalcanal, and it was also a major WWII battle site, so there are a lot of wrecks – sunken ships, planes, all sorts of stuff that we used to scuba dive or freedive to explore.</p>
            
            <p>I never saw human remains underwater but I found them in the jungle, on a plantation there. There's so much ordnance that washes up there, every time it rains you'd see ammunition, grenade pins, grenade fragments, you name it. I had sacks full of ammunition, helmets with bullet holes through, water canteens that you could still use, bayonets, guns – the lot!</p>
            
            <p>And every now and then a coconut would fall out of a tree and you'd hear an explosion out on the plantation.</p>
            
            <p>That's how I was brought up – no TV, one radio station in pidgin english, and my brother and I were either in the jungle or in the water – spearfishing, freediving, diving – our whole childhood.</p>
            
            <h3>Professional Diving Journey</h3>
            
            <p><strong>When did you get certified?</strong></p>
            
            <p>I did a lot of diving before I was officially certified of course, and then I did my proper certification in Papua New Guinea when I moved there.</p>
            
            <p>And then I went through to Advanced, Rescue, did a lot of speciality courses, and then tec dive training – I'm a certified technical diver as well – so I was a very experienced diver when I did my Divemaster, and then straight onto Instructor, when I first moved here about seven years ago.</p>
            
            <p>I'm an IDC Staff Instructor now and I definitely have plans to go on, ultimately to become a Course Director.</p>
            
            <h3>Favorite Dive Sites and DPV Safaris</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What's your favourite place to dive here in Puerto Galera?</strong></p>
            
            <p>Well for a standalone dive site, of course Verde Island is absolutely amazing.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm a bit of an adrenaline diver, I like a good drift dive, but my DPV safaris are by far my favourite form of diving.</p>
            
            <p>I did two today: the first dive was West Escarceo, Canyons, Shark Cave, Atoll, into Kilima; and then the second was Wreck Point all the way back here to the resort.</p>
            
            <p>That's Wreck Point, Dungon Wall, Ernie's Point, Monkey Beach, Sabang Point, Sabang Wrecks, Fantasea Reef, and walk up the beach to the resort.</p>
            
            <p>So that's seven dive sites in one dive, and you just see so much.</p>
            
            <h3>Underwater as Outer Space</h3>
            
            <p><strong>What's your favourite thing to see underwater?</strong></p>
            
            <p>Thresher sharks. They're just such beautiful, majestic creatures. And I like the fact they're quite shy. Plus they're not going to bite me either!</p>
            
            <p>But when it comes to diving, I think of underwater as a poor man's outer space.</p>
            
            <p>You're totally weightless, and you're seeing stuff no-one else can see. It's a feeling almost of flying, and to become a good diver, it's almost like meditating when you're underwater – controlling your air supply. And it's just so peaceful.</p>
            
            <h3>Papua New Guinea: An Undiscovered Gem</h3>
            
            <p><strong>You've dived all over the Pacific. Other than Puerto Galera what's your favourite place to dive?</strong></p>
            
            <p>I would class Papua New Guinea as one of the world's most undiscovered dive destinations.</p>
            
            <p>There's only a very small handful of dive resorts there, but even out of the capital, Port Moresby, there's amazing diving there.</p>
            
            <p>Beautiful reefs, amazing wrecks, abundant shark life, so I really feel it's an undiscovered dive destination.</p>
            
            <p>But there's a reason it's undiscovered – it's a dangerous country to go to. In fact the safest place in Papua New Guinea may well be underwater!</p>
            
            <h3>Learn from the Best</h3>

            <h2>West Escarceo: A Classic Puerto Galera Dive Site</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Dive site name:</strong> West Escarceo</p>
            <p><strong>Dive type:</strong> wall dive, reef dive, drift dive</p>
            <p><strong>Depth:</strong> 5m – 25m</p>
            <p><strong>Viz:</strong> 10m to 30m</p>
            <p><strong>Skill level:</strong> beginner and up</p>
            <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> five minutes by boat</p>
            
            <p>A classic Puerto Galera dive site, West Escarceo has a split personality depending on the moon and the tides.</p>
            
            <p>Will you be whipped along weightlessly, flying past boulders, critters, and schools of fish, or will you enjoy a sedate and gentle exploration of the minutiae of the Verde Island Passage's incredible underwater life? Only the current will tell!</p>
            
            <h3>Getting to West Escarceo</h3>
            
            <p>We jump on a speedboat from Lalaguna Villas (enjoying as always the shady canopy, the helpful staff, the supplies of shampoo to clear our masks, and the powerful engines which make the trip so quick) and in four minutes we're across Sabang Bay, a few hundred metres up the Sinandigan headland, and ready to backroll in at West Escarceo.</p>
            
            <p>This is one of the continuous run of dive sites from Sabang Point to the Canyons which run northward off the coast of the headland.</p>
            
            <h3>What You'll See</h3>
            
            <p>The first thing you will notice upon beginning your descent is the sheer abundance of fish teeming above the gently sloping reef which starts at about five metres.</p>
            
            <p>Redtooth triggerfish, butterflyfish, parrotfish, damselfish and even schools of jacks and baby barracudas zip and swish past, dancing and chasing one another over and through the corals.</p>
            
            <p>As you swim downwards, you will notice the variety of hard and soft corals which are beset by beautiful feather stars in striking reds, greens, and yellows.</p>
            
            <p>Many of the boulder corals here are also adorned with beautiful christmas tree tubeworms, entirely deserving of their festive name, which spiral out of their protective casings, venturing upwards into the water in ever decreasing concentric spirals of orange, blue-tipped white, red, black, or multiple colours, looking like tiny stylised christmas trees no more than an inch high.</p>
            
            <p>Watch them retract instantaneously into the protection of the coral if your wash passes too near – or bide your time and wait for them to start to peak back out.</p>
            
            <h3>Deeper Discoveries</h3>
            
            <p>Further down, the reef features large coral boulders, before levelling out at a sandy area at about 25 meters, where if you're lucky you'll spy a blue spotted stingray.</p>
            
            <p>West Escarceo is also blessed with unusual delights including scorpionfish, stonefish, and octopus, all experts at camoflage and deception, so you will need to keep your eyes keenly peeled to spot these critters on their shelves or in their dens.</p>
            
            <p>Large puffer fish, including several species with beautiful radial markings around the eyes, are spotted here on nearly every dive, and big groupers including some extremely colourful varieties often make an appearance.</p>
            
            <p>Schools become more common as we approach Escarceo point with stronger currents, so look out for big mouth mackerels, juvenile tunas, trevallies and emperor fish.</p>
            
            <p>While you're lower on the reef you're also likely to see pipefish, damselfish, sergeant majors and Moorish idols, as well as the several species of sea cucumber which call this area home.</p>
            
            <h3>Drift Diving Adventure</h3>
            
            <p>If the tide is flooding and the current is running fast this makes for an epic drift dive, with the water taking you out northward as far as "Hole in the Wall", an interesting dive site in its own right, with a picturesque three-metre long tunnel about one metre in diameter through a reef wall.</p>
            
            <p>If you're opted to dive on Nitrox you'll probably have enough bottom time to head on to briefly explore The Canyons, another of Puerto Galera's most beautiful dive sites.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Come and join us!</strong></p>

            <h2>Three Verde Island Trips in One Morning</h2>
            
            <p>Over the Labour Day long weekend, Lalaguna Villas had the pleasure of hosting something truly special: <strong>three exclusive Verde Island trips in one morning</strong> — a record-setting day for our dive team, and an unforgettable experience for our guests.</p>
            
            <p>On Sunday, May 4th, LLV Divers delivered the ultimate Verde Island experience, setting off at <strong>6:00am, 8:00am, and 10:00am</strong> with three small, personalised groups of divers. With crystal-clear visibility, minimal current, and vibrant reef activity, conditions couldn't have been better. From giant schools of anthias to dramatic drop-offs, the Verde magic was on full display.</p>
            
            <h3>How We Made It Possible</h3>
            
            <p>You might be wondering — <em>how is it even possible to run three trips to Verde Island in a single morning?</em></p>
            
            <p>At LLV Divers, we don't need to wait around for large groups to fill a boat. Our <strong>modern speedboats</strong>, built for comfort and speed, can whisk <strong>4–8 divers</strong> to Verde in just <strong>20 minutes</strong>. No crowded, slow bangkas. No exhausting hours spent on the water. Just fast, efficient, VIP diving at its best.</p>
            
            <p>While most operations in the area offer just one Verde trip per day (and often with large groups crammed onto slow boats), LLV is able to run <strong>multiple departures</strong> thanks to our <strong>high-powered fleet</strong>, <strong>flexible scheduling</strong>, and our commitment to <strong>small-group, high-touch service</strong>. It's not just possible — it's what we <em>do</em>, week in and week out.</p>
            
            <p>Each group received the full VIP treatment — <strong>valet diving service</strong>, <strong>premium Scubapro gear</strong>, and <strong>expert local guidance</strong> with a <strong>maximum 4:1 diver-to-guide ratio</strong>, ensuring a personal, safe, and enriching experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Regular Verde Island Program</h3>
            
            <p>For us, this isn't a one-off event. LLV Divers runs Verde Island trips <strong>four to five times every week</strong>, and we have the ability to tailor trips based on demand — morning, midday, or even multiple trips in a single day!</p>
            
            <p>As the only <strong>PADI 5-Star Development Resort in Sabang</strong> offering this level of speed, flexibility, and service, LLV has built a reputation for <strong>consistency, safety, and genuine hospitality</strong>. Whether you're a guest dreaming of a bucket-list dive or a travel partner looking to refer clients to a world-class operator, our Verde Island program stands out — <strong>reliable, efficient, and truly exceptional</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>A Dive Resort Built for Purpose</h3>
            
            <p>Aaron's group chose <strong>Lalaguna Villas</strong> not just for our location — perched on the edge of Small Lalaguna Beach, surrounded by some of the most biodiverse waters in the world — but for the complete dive experience we offer. Our on-site PADI 5-Star Dive Centre meant the group could go from breakfast to briefing to backroll in a matter of minutes. With luxury rooms, a 24/7 restaurant, and a private fleet of dive boats at their disposal, everything was designed to maximise their time in the water while enjoying world-class hospitality on land.</p>
            
            <p>It was a seamless fit from the very beginning. Each day began with the buzz of dive gear being prepped and cylinders being filled, followed by back-to-back boat departures to sites like <strong>The Canyons</strong>, <strong>Hole in the Wall</strong>, and <strong>Monkey Beach</strong>. The weather was on our side — warm, clear, and calm — allowing for multiple dives per day, with many divers doing up to four.</p>
            
            <p>With nearly <strong>200 dives</strong> logged in a week, the group explored every corner of the bay's underwater landscape, from gentle coral slopes teeming with anemonefish to high-voltage drift dives where schooling trevally and barracuda flashed past in silver unison. They encountered <strong>macro favourites</strong> like frogfish and ghost pipefish, as well as <strong>pelagic visitors</strong>, turtles, and moray eels tucked into rock crevices along Puerto Galera's renowned current-swept channels.</p>
            
            <h3>Specialty Training at a Professional Standard</h3>
            
            <p>This was far more than a casual dive holiday. Under Aaron's guidance and in collaboration with our own instructors, several divers undertook advanced training to further refine their skills and open up new pathways in their diving journey.</p>
            
            <p>Among the standout experiences was the completion of <strong>four Enriched Air (Nitrox) courses</strong>, allowing divers to extend their bottom times and safely enjoy longer multi-dive days — a clear advantage in a destination with this much to offer. The group also embraced the thrill of <strong>Diver Propulsion Vehicle (DPV) training</strong>, with two of their members gliding across the reefs on powerful underwater scooters, covering more ground with ease and experiencing a whole new sense of freedom.</p>
            
            <p>It's one thing to dive a site like <strong>West Escarceo</strong>, but to fly through it with a DPV? That's something else entirely.</p>
            
            <h3>Thinking About Diving Verde Island?</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Now you know where to start — only with LLV Divers.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Stay tuned — we'll be sharing group photos, diver highlights, and more stories from this incredible day soon!</p>
